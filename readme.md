When your cell is hitted, it colours red. 
And if you kill a ship, there are dots around it that means that the ships is killed and there are no cells to be fired.
At the top of the screen you can see yours and your enemys's ships remaining.

The game stops when a player  has fired all enemys' ships. 
If you have at least one not bitten cell, you are the winner!
